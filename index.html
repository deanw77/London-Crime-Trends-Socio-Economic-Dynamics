                <h3>We first take a brief look at the distribution of crime across the London Boroughs</h3>
                <br />
                <p>We can see that central London is a hotspot for crime. This largely due to much higher rates of theft
                    in central London. In fact theft Accounts for over 50% of all crime in Central London. The next most
                    common crime is violence against the person, which accounts for around 20% of all crime in Central
                    London.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>If we filter by Burglary and Violence we see a much more even distribution across the London Boroughs

                        <p>In August 2011, London experienced a significant crime spike and widespread civil unrest,
                            including riots that involved looting, arson, and violence. The unrest was triggered by the
                            police shooting of Mark Duggan in Tottenham, London. During the five days of disorder, more
                            than 5,000 crimes were committed, mainly burglary, criminal damage, and violence against
                            persons, with five fatalities according to the Royal Economic Society and the Home Office.
                            In the affected areas, crime rose by 57% during August. </p>

                <h3>Deep dive to how unemployment rates effect both the total crime and the types of crime.</h3>
                <br />
                <p>...we can see that there is a strong correlation between unemployment rates and crime rates.
                    As unemployment rates increase, so do crime rates. This is particularly true for theft and burglary,
                    which are the most common types of crime in London.
