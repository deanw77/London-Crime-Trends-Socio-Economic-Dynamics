                <h3>We first take a brief look at the distribution of crime across the London Boroughs</h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                    We can see that central London is a hotspot for crime. This largely due to much higher rates of
                    theft
                    in central London. In fact theft Accounts for over 50% of all crime in Central London. The next most
                    common crime is violence against the person, which accounts for around 20% of all crime in Central
                    London.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>If we remove theft from the data we get a more even distribution of crime across the
                    boroughs.
                    This is because theft is much more common in central London, where there are more people and more
                    opportunities for theft. In contrast, violence against the person is more evenly distributed across
                    the boroughs.

                        <p>In August 2011, London experienced a significant crime spike and widespread civil unrest,
                            including riots that involved looting, arson, and violence. The unrest was triggered by the
                            police shooting of Mark Duggan. According to the Royal Economic Society
                            and the Home Office in the affected areas, crime rose by 57% during August. </p>

                        <p>In 2019, the British Transport Police released an online reporting tool. This led to increase
                            in recorded crime but not necesarily reflecting an increase in crime, as incidents that
                            usually would not have been reported were now being recorded.</p>

                            tracking, is playing a role in reducing street theft by making stolen phones less desirable
                            to thieves. Along with the fact less people carry cash, street robbery is falling</p>
